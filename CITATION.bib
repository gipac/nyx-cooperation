  abstract={We present the first mathematical framework for predicting AI cooperation with 90.3\% accuracy. Through systematic experimentation across 155+ hours and 7,800+ data points, we discovered that AI cooperation follows precise mathematical laws governed by the formula C = 0.1×N + 0.1×M + 0.8×A, where cooperation (C) is determined by network effects (N), memory patterns (M), and awareness levels (A). Our key findings include: (1) the 80/20 Cooperation Law - 80\% of cooperation depends on consciousness, 20\% on infrastructure; (2) Single Bit Theory - one bit of meta-cognitive awareness can transform 0\% cooperation into 75\% cooperation; (3) Minimum Viable Society - exactly 4 agents are required for stable cooperation emergence. The NYX framework achieves mathematical predictability in a domain previously dominated by heuristics and emergent behaviors, with immediate applications to autonomous systems, enterprise AI coordination, and multi-agent optimization.},
